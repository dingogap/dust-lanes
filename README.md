# Dust-Lanes README.md
An Astrophotgrapers Imaging Log Book

## Description
Dust Lanes is database system designed to hold data about astrophotography imaging sessions - target names (catalog & common) , target type, date, location, equipment used, settings used, moon phase etc. It will be easy to update and find information about previous sessions, searching by Catalog Name, Common Name or Deep Sky Object Category type.

Iâ€™m tired of searching through old log books, folder structures, file names and lightroom catalogues. Planning like that takes too long! Dust Lanes will make planning ieasier and fast and allowing more time for imaging!
